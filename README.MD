# Introduction

- Better Low Fire focuses, among other things, on reducing the visibility of fire in first-person mode.

- The project was created to fix the missing "blue fire" texture in the built-in Lunar Client resource pack that was added with the Nether Update.

- Can be used everywhere on different versions and Clients.
